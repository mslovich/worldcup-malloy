# FIFA World Cup — Malloy + DuckDB

A [Malloy](https://www.malloydata.dev/) semantic model over the **Fjelstul World Cup
Database** — every men's (1930–2022) and women's (1991–2019) FIFA World Cup match,
goal, booking, squad and standing. Data is pulled as CSV, stored locally as Parquet,
and queried with DuckDB.

## Quick start

The model reads its Parquet directly from Google Cloud Storage
(`https://storage.googleapis.com/malloyyo/worldcup/*.parquet`), so a fresh clone
works immediately — no download step (just an internet connection). A committed
copy also lives at `data/parquet/*.parquet` (~1.5 MB); that's the source that
gets uploaded to GCS.

```bash
# 1. Node deps for the Malloy runner
npm install

# 2. Run a query
npm run query -- "goals -> top_scorers"
npm run topscorers
```

**Refreshing the data is optional** — only needed to pull upstream updates or
regenerate from scratch (requires `pip install duckdb`):

```bash
python3 ingest.py     # re-download CSVs → data/parquet/*.parquet  (~25s)
python3 validate.py   # check referential integrity
```

---

## How the data is pulled

`ingest.py` is **datapackage-driven**. It reads datahub's
[`datapackage.json`](https://datahub.io/football/worldcup/_r/-/datapackage.json),
iterates the resources, and downloads each CSV via its permanent "r-link" URL
(`https://datahub.io/football/worldcup/_r/-/<file>.csv`) using DuckDB's `httpfs`
extension, writing one Parquet file per table.

Because the resource list comes from the live datapackage, **re-running picks up
upstream updates automatically** (new tournament editions, new/changed columns) — no
hardcoded table list to maintain.

```bash
python3 ingest.py                      # 27 core relational tables (default)
python3 ingest.py --include-summaries  # also the 9 pre-aggregated summary CSVs
python3 ingest.py --tables matches,goals
```

Raw CSVs are cached under `data/csv/`; typed Parquet lands in `data/parquet/`.
The `data/parquet/` files are **committed to the repo** (kept as the upload
source); the larger raw `data/csv/` cache is git-ignored. Re-running `ingest.py`
overwrites the Parquet in place.

The Malloy model itself reads from Google Cloud Storage, so publishing refreshed
data is a two-step flow — regenerate, then upload:

```bash
python3 ingest.py                                          # refresh data/parquet/*.parquet
gsutil -m cp data/parquet/*.parquet gs://malloyyo/worldcup/  # publish to GCS
```

## Tables (27 core)

| Group | Tables |
|---|---|
| **Lookups** | `tournaments`, `teams`, `players`, `stadiums`, `managers`, `referees`, `confederations` |
| **Match facts** | `matches`, `team_appearances`, `player_appearances`, `manager_appearances`, `referee_appearances` |
| **In-match events** | `goals`, `bookings`, `substitutions`, `penalty_kicks` |
| **Tournament structure** | `tournament_stages`, `groups`, `group_standings`, `tournament_standings`, `qualified_teams`, `host_countries` |
| **Rosters & people** | `squads`, `manager_appointments`, `referee_appointments` |
| **Awards** | `awards`, `award_winners` |

### Keys, grains & joins

The data is **heavily denormalized** — most event tables already carry
`tournament_name`, `team_name`, `match_name` etc. inline, so you rarely need a join
just to read a label. The model adds joins so measures roll up cleanly and so you can
correlate facts that share an actor.

Real join keys are the **domain IDs** (all `VARCHAR`, e.g. `WC-1930`); the model
correlates facts at **four grains**:

```
match              match_id                  events within a match
team-match         (team_id, match_id)       what a team did in a match
player-match       (player_id, match_id)     what a player did in a match
tournament-team    (tournament_id, team_id)  who hosted / qualified / WON an edition
```

Every fact source is a fully-dimensioned **entry point**: pick the one matching your
question's grain (`goals` for goal questions, `bookings` for cards,
`team_appearances` for team records, `matches` for match-level / dashboards) and slice
by its dimensions. Cross-fact correlations (e.g. "players sent off who also scored")
use composite-key joins that are baked in.

> **Implementation note:** *dimension* lookups (`goals → teams`, `→ players`, …) are
> source-to-source joins; *cross-fact* joins (event↔event, manager↔team, career honors)
> join the raw `duckdb.table(...)` instead, which keeps the source graph acyclic and the
> composite joins fan-out-free. `key_id` is a per-table row surrogate, **not** a
> cross-table key.

**Gotchas baked into the model:**
- **Men's & women's are unified** — `gender` is defined once, on `tournaments`, and
  every fact reaches it through its tournament join. Default views (e.g.
  `top_scorers`) mix both; filter with `where: tournament.gender = 'Women'` to
  separate them.
- **`penalty` vs shootouts** — in-run-of-play penalties are in `goals` (`is_penalty`);
  penalty-*shootout* kicks are the separate `shootout_kicks` source.
- **Round ordering** — `stage_name` mixes singular ("quarter-final", women's) and
  plural ("quarter-finals", men's) and sorts alphabetically (Final < Quarter-…).
  Join `stage_ref` (on `stage_name`) for an orderable `stage_rank` (1 group … 6
  final) and a normalized `stage_label`; `team_tournament_progress` rolls this up
  to the furthest round each nation reached. `matches`/`team_appearances` also
  expose `decided_by` (Regulation/Extra time/Shootout) and `is_cross_confederation`.
  Note: the third-place match shares `stage_rank` 5 with the semi-finals (both are
  semifinal-stage depth), so it sorts with the semis and counts as "semis reached".
- **Own goals** — `goals` separates `scoring_team` (counts for) from `player_team`
  (scorer's side); `top_scorers` excludes own goals. Team goals come from
  `team_appearances.goals_scored` (authoritative).
- `year` is reserved in Malloy — exposed as `edition_year` on `tournaments` /
  `match_year` on `matches`.
- Boolean-ish flags (`win`, `own_goal`, `penalty`, `yellow_card`, …) are `0/1` ints and
  `sum()` straight into counts.
- Mononyms (Marta, Pelé, Cafu) have `given_name = 'not applicable'`; the
  `full_name` / `scorer` dimensions handle this.

**Known data limitations:**
- **No attendance data** (the summary CSVs aren't ingested); only
  `stadiums.stadium_capacity` is available.
- **Lineups / positions (`player_appearances`) exist from 1970 onward only.** Goals,
  bookings, results and standings cover every edition.
- **Minutes-played metrics are 1970+ too.** `minutes_played` / `total_minutes` /
  `goals_per_90` / `minutes_per_goal` are reconstructed from `player_appearances`
  + `substitutions`, so they share the 1970+ window. Match length is taken as 90
  minutes (120 when the match went to extra time — there is no explicit duration
  column), and minutes after a red-card sending-off are not yet subtracted. A few
  substitute appearances lack a coming-on event and default to minute 0.

## The model

`worldcup.malloy` defines the sources, joins, measures and named views.
`explore.malloy` is a set of ready-to-run example analyses.

Some named views:

| Source | View | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| `goals` | `top_scorers` | All-time top scorers (excl. own goals) |
| `goals` | `top_scorers_never_won` | Top scorers who never won the Cup |
| `goals` | `goals_by_minute` | Goal distribution across regulation minutes |
| `matches` | `by_tournament` | Matches / goals / avg goals per edition |
| `matches` | `highest_scoring` | Highest-scoring matches ever |
| `matches` | `match_dashboard` | Goals + cards nested for filtered matches |
| `team_appearances` | `by_team` | Appearances, W/D/L, goals per nation |
| `team_appearances` | `by_confederation` | Same, rolled up by confederation |
| `team_appearances` | `head_to_head` | Records by team vs opponent |
| `tournament_standings` | `most_titles` | Most World Cup titles by nation |
| `manager_appearances` | `top_attacking_managers` | Most goals/game under management |
| `referee_appearances` | `strictest_referees` | Cards shown per match by referee |
| `bookings` | `dirtiest_matches` / `cards_by_referee` | Discipline rollups |
| `player_appearances` | `minutes_leaders` | Most minutes played ever (1970+) |
| `player_appearances` | `top_goals_per_90` | Best goals per 90 (1970+, min 270 min) |
| `player_match_scoring` | `hat_tricks` / `most_hat_tricks` | Hat-tricks & multi-goal games |
| `team_tournament_progress` | `by_team` | Furthest round reached, by nation |
| `shootout_kicks` | `by_player` | Shootout record by taker |
| `award_winners` | `by_award` | Winners by award type (self-describing) |

## Running queries

### Recommended: `run.mjs`

`run.mjs` compiles the model against DuckDB using the core
`@malloydata/malloy` + `@malloydata/db-duckdb` libraries:

```bash
node run.mjs "goals -> top_scorers"
node run.mjs "team_appearances -> by_team"
node run.mjs --model worldcup.malloy "matches -> highest_scoring"

# or via npm
npm run query -- "matches -> by_tournament"
```

### Malloy CLI / VS Code

`explore.malloy` contains `run:` statements meant for the official Malloy tooling:

- **VS Code:** install the *Malloy* extension and open `explore.malloy` — each
  `run:` gets a ▶ button.
- **CLI:** `npm run cli` (`malloy-cli run explore.malloy`).

> ⚠️ `malloy-cli@0.0.38` currently crashes on **Node ≥ 24** (a bundled HTTP-agent
> dependency throws at import). If you hit that, use `run.mjs` (works on any Node) or
> run the CLI under Node 20/22. The VS Code extension is unaffected.

---

## MCP server

`mcp_server.mjs` exposes the model to [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) clients
(Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) over **stdio**. `.mcp.json` registers it as the
`worldcup` server, so a client that reads that file picks it up automatically; you can
also start it manually with `npm run mcp`.

It exposes **two** tools:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `describe_model` | Returns the full `worldcup.malloy` source — sources, joins, measures, views. Call this first. |
| `run_malloy_query` | Runs a Malloy expression against the model, e.g. `"goals -> top_scorers"` or an ad-hoc `"matches -> { group_by: tournament_name; aggregate: match_count is count() }"`. |

**All queries go through the Malloy semantic model** — there is intentionally no
raw-SQL tool, so the agent can't bypass the model's joins, measures, and views.

Like the CLI runner, the server uses the core `@malloydata/*` libraries (no separate
process or port). The model reads its Parquet from Google Cloud Storage over `httpfs`,
so it works from any clone with no local data or ingest step.
