# FIFA World Cup — Malloy + DuckDB

A [Malloy](https://www.malloydata.dev/) semantic model over the **Fjelstul World Cup
Database** — every men's (1930–2022) and women's (1991–2019) FIFA World Cup match,
goal, booking, squad and standing. Data is pulled as CSV, stored locally as Parquet,
and queried with DuckDB.

## Quick start

The data ships with the repo (`data/parquet/*.parquet`, ~1.5 MB, committed), so a
fresh clone works immediately — no download step:

```bash
# 1. Node deps for the Malloy runner
npm install

# 2. Run a query
npm run query -- "goals -> top_scorers"
npm run topscorers
```

**Refreshing the data is optional** — only needed to pull upstream updates or
regenerate from scratch (requires `pip install duckdb`):

```bash
python3 ingest.py     # re-download CSVs → data/parquet/*.parquet  (~25s)
python3 validate.py   # check referential integrity
```

---

## How the data is pulled

`ingest.py` is **datapackage-driven**. It reads datahub's
[`datapackage.json`](https://datahub.io/football/worldcup/_r/-/datapackage.json),
iterates the resources, and downloads each CSV via its permanent "r-link" URL
(`https://datahub.io/football/worldcup/_r/-/<file>.csv`) using DuckDB's `httpfs`
extension, writing one Parquet file per table.

Because the resource list comes from the live datapackage, **re-running picks up
upstream updates automatically** (new tournament editions, new/changed columns) — no
hardcoded table list to maintain.

```bash
python3 ingest.py                      # 27 core relational tables (default)
python3 ingest.py --include-summaries  # also the 9 pre-aggregated summary CSVs
python3 ingest.py --tables matches,goals
```

Raw CSVs are cached under `data/csv/`; typed Parquet lands in `data/parquet/`.
The `data/parquet/` files are **committed to the repo** (so clones and Malloy
Publisher work without an ingest step); the larger raw `data/csv/` cache is
git-ignored. Re-running `ingest.py` overwrites the Parquet in place — commit the
result to publish refreshed data.

## Tables (27 core)

| Group | Tables |
|---|---|
| **Lookups** | `tournaments`, `teams`, `players`, `stadiums`, `managers`, `referees`, `confederations` |
| **Match facts** | `matches`, `team_appearances`, `player_appearances`, `manager_appearances`, `referee_appearances` |
| **In-match events** | `goals`, `bookings`, `substitutions`, `penalty_kicks` |
| **Tournament structure** | `tournament_stages`, `groups`, `group_standings`, `tournament_standings`, `qualified_teams`, `host_countries` |
| **Rosters & people** | `squads`, `manager_appointments`, `referee_appointments` |
| **Awards** | `awards`, `award_winners` |

### Keys, grains & joins

The data is **heavily denormalized** — most event tables already carry
`tournament_name`, `team_name`, `match_name` etc. inline, so you rarely need a join
just to read a label. The model adds joins so measures roll up cleanly and so you can
correlate facts that share an actor.

Real join keys are the **domain IDs** (all `VARCHAR`, e.g. `WC-1930`); the model
correlates facts at **four grains**:

```
match              match_id                  events within a match
team-match         (team_id, match_id)       what a team did in a match
player-match       (player_id, match_id)     what a player did in a match
tournament-team    (tournament_id, team_id)  who hosted / qualified / WON an edition
```

Every fact source is a fully-dimensioned **entry point**: pick the one matching your
question's grain (`goals` for goal questions, `bookings` for cards,
`team_appearances` for team records, `matches` for match-level / dashboards) and slice
by its dimensions. Cross-fact correlations (e.g. "players sent off who also scored")
use composite-key joins that are baked in.

> **Implementation note:** *dimension* lookups (`goals → teams`, `→ players`, …) are
> source-to-source joins; *cross-fact* joins (event↔event, manager↔team, career honors)
> join the raw `duckdb.table(...)` instead, which keeps the source graph acyclic and the
> composite joins fan-out-free. `key_id` is a per-table row surrogate, **not** a
> cross-table key.

**Gotchas baked into the model:**
- **Men's & women's are unified** — every fact exposes a `gender` dimension (derived
  from the tournament). Default views (e.g. `top_scorers`) mix both; filter with
  `where: gender = 'Women'` to separate them.
- **`penalty` vs shootouts** — in-run-of-play penalties are in `goals` (`is_penalty`);
  penalty-*shootout* kicks are the separate `shootout_kicks` source.
- **Own goals** — `goals` separates `scoring_team` (counts for) from `player_team`
  (scorer's side); `top_scorers` excludes own goals. Team goals come from
  `team_appearances.goals_scored` (authoritative).
- `year` is reserved in Malloy — exposed as `edition_year` on `tournaments` /
  `match_year` on `matches`.
- Boolean-ish flags (`win`, `own_goal`, `penalty`, `yellow_card`, …) are `0/1` ints and
  `sum()` straight into counts.
- Mononyms (Marta, Pelé, Cafu) have `given_name = 'not applicable'`; the
  `full_name` / `scorer` dimensions handle this.

**Known data limitations:**
- **No attendance data** (the summary CSVs aren't ingested); only
  `stadiums.stadium_capacity` is available.
- **Lineups / positions (`player_appearances`) exist from 1970 onward only.** Goals,
  bookings, results and standings cover every edition.

## The model

`worldcup.malloy` defines the sources, joins, measures and named views.
`explore.malloy` is a set of ready-to-run example analyses.

Some named views:

| Source | View | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| `goals` | `top_scorers` | All-time top scorers (excl. own goals) |
| `goals` | `top_scorers_never_won` | Top scorers who never won the Cup |
| `goals` | `goals_by_minute` | Goal distribution across regulation minutes |
| `matches` | `by_tournament` | Matches / goals / avg goals per edition |
| `matches` | `highest_scoring` | Highest-scoring matches ever |
| `matches` | `match_dashboard` | Goals + cards nested for filtered matches |
| `team_appearances` | `by_team` | Appearances, W/D/L, goals per nation |
| `team_appearances` | `by_confederation` | Same, rolled up by confederation |
| `team_appearances` | `head_to_head` | Records by team vs opponent |
| `tournament_standings` | `most_titles` | Most World Cup titles by nation |
| `manager_appearances` | `top_attacking_managers` | Most goals/game under management |
| `referee_appearances` | `strictest_referees` | Cards shown per match by referee |
| `bookings` | `dirtiest_matches` / `cards_by_referee` | Discipline rollups |

## Running queries

### Recommended: `run.mjs`

`run.mjs` compiles the model against DuckDB using the core
`@malloydata/malloy` + `@malloydata/db-duckdb` libraries:

```bash
node run.mjs "goals -> top_scorers"
node run.mjs "team_appearances -> by_team"
node run.mjs --model worldcup.malloy "matches -> highest_scoring"

# or via npm
npm run query -- "matches -> by_tournament"
```

### Malloy CLI / VS Code

`explore.malloy` contains `run:` statements meant for the official Malloy tooling:

- **VS Code:** install the *Malloy* extension and open `explore.malloy` — each
  `run:` gets a ▶ button.
- **CLI:** `npm run cli` (`malloy-cli run explore.malloy`).

> ⚠️ `malloy-cli@0.0.38` currently crashes on **Node ≥ 24** (a bundled HTTP-agent
> dependency throws at import). If you hit that, use `run.mjs` (works on any Node) or
> run the CLI under Node 20/22. The VS Code extension is unaffected.

## MCP server

`mcp_server.mjs` exposes the model to [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) clients
(Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) over **stdio**. `.mcp.json` registers it as the
`worldcup` server, so a client that reads that file picks it up automatically; you can
also start it manually with `npm run mcp`.

It exposes **two** tools:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `describe_model` | Returns the full `worldcup.malloy` source — sources, joins, measures, views. Call this first. |
| `run_malloy_query` | Runs a Malloy expression against the model, e.g. `"goals -> top_scorers"` or an ad-hoc `"matches -> { group_by: tournament_name; aggregate: match_count is count() }"`. |

**All queries go through the Malloy semantic model** — there is intentionally no
raw-SQL tool, so the agent can't bypass the model's joins, measures, and views.

Like the CLI runner, the server uses the core `@malloydata/*` libraries (no separate
process or port) and resolves `data/parquet/*` relative to its own location. Since the
Parquet is committed, it works from any clone with no ingest step.
